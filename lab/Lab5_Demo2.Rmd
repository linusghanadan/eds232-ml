## R
```{r}
kaggle_dat <- read_csv(here::here("lab", "data", "genres_v2.csv"))
unique(kaggle_dat$genre)
table(kaggle_dat$genre)

#Removing inappropriate columns and selecting trap and Hiphop as the two genres here and making case consistent

genre_dat <- kaggle_dat %>%
  select(-c(type, uri, track_href, analysis_url, `Unnamed: 0`, title, tempo, id, song_name)) %>%
  filter(genre == "Hiphop"|genre == "Rap") %>%
  mutate(genre = str_replace(genre, "Hiphop", "hiphop")) %>%
  mutate(genre = str_replace(genre, "Rap", "rap")) %>%
  mutate(genre = as.factor(genre))
```

```{r}
##split the data
genre_split 
```

```{r recipe}
#Preprocess the data
genre_rec <- 
  
```

Set up a decision tree specification. Note: the cost_complexity parameter is a pruning penalty parameter that controls how much we penalize the number of terminal nodes in the tree.  It's conceptually similar to lambda from regularized regression.

```{r tree_specification}
tree_spec_fixed 
```

But, as usual, we don't want just any old values for our hyperparameters, we want optimal values.
```{r}
#new spec, tell the model that we are tuning hyperparams
tree_spec_tune 
tree_grid
```

```{r workflow_tree}
wf_tree_tune <- 
```

```{r resampling}
#set up k-fold cv. This can be used for all the algorithms
genre_cv 

```

```{r}
doParallel::registerDoParallel() #build trees in parallel
#200s

tree_rs
```
Use autoplot() to examine how different parameter configurations relate to accuracy 
```{r}

```

```{r select_hyperparam}

```

We can finalize the model specification where we have replaced the tune functions with optimized values.

```{r final_tree_spec}
final_tree <- 
```

This model has not been fit yet though.

```{r final_tree_fit}
#similar functions here.
final_tree_fit <-  
```

#Visualize variable importance
```{r tree_vip}
final_tree_fit

```
